ColorIT is a small company developing and implementing IT systems mostly for private customers. However, the owner of the company has no project management system at the moment and therefore, he is in need of such system in order to handle tasks and proper time usage for their company’s IT systems. 
The problem is a project takes time and Mr. Color is currently unable to manage both his company and project system developing. That being said, he would love to hire someone eager enough to develop and create such system, reaching first semester students at VIA to provide them with an opportunity to experience first-hand practice on project creation and eventually offer them a part-time job if they prove to be good enough. 
In that way, both VIA first semester students and Mr. Color would benefit from the situation. VIA students would be a part of a real-time IT company workflow and environment, while Mr. Color would put himself in customer’s shoes in order to witness from first person view how he should properly adjust his approach for future clients of ColorIT.
